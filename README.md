# **Income Risk Estimation Across Caste Groups in India**

This repository focuses on the estimation of income risks across heterogeneous caste groups in India, examining disparities and variations within and across these groups. The analysis aims to provide insights into how income risks differ by caste, contributing to the broader understanding of economic inequalities and their implications for policy design.  

Detailed explanations of the methodology, dataset, and results will be added soon.
