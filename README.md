# Income Risk Estimation Across Caste Groups in India

This repository explores income risk estimation across caste groups in India, focusing on variations and disparities within different groups. Detailed explanations of the methodology and repository structure will be added soon.  

For now, you can review the income risk estimation process in the `02_code` folder:  

- **`estimation_code.ipynb`**: Contains the code for income risk estimation across the entire population.  
- **`estimate_caste_groups.ipynb`**: Includes the codes and methodology for segregating each caste group. The analysis is restricted to male heads of households who are considered breadwinners in India, within the earning age group of 25 to 60 years.
